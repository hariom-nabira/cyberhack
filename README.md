## **A Spam Profile Detection Mobile App**  

### 📌 Overview 

Social media fraud is a growing issue, with fake profiles and engagement manipulation becoming rampant. Among various platforms, Instagram and LinkedIn are the two most affected by fraudulent activities, such as fake influencers, bot-driven engagement, and deceptive professional profiles. These scams mislead users, brands, and recruiters, causing financial and reputational damage.

Our mobile app helps identify spam profiles using **machine learning models**, analyzing **engagement metrics** and **follower-following ratios**. Additionally, it leverages the **Reclaim Protocol** to ensure that users give **explicit consent** before sharing their data. Users who participate in data sharing are **incentivized** with rewards.

## **📌 How Spam Profiles Are Detected**  

Our approach is inspired by findings from the **Systematic Literature Review on Instagram Fake Account Detection Based on Machine Learning** ([ResearchGate Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358590043_Systematic_Literature_Review_Instagram_Fake_Account_Detection_Based_on_Machine_Learning)).  

Key spam indicators include:  
✅ **Low engagement despite high followers**  
✅ **Excessive use of hashtags in posts**  
✅ **Frequent but meaningless comments**  
✅ **Unrealistic follower-following ratio**  
✅ **Absence of a real profile picture**  

📌 **Engagement Ratio Formula:**  
```math
Engagement Rate = [(Likes + Comments) ÷ Followers]×100
```
<br>

The **ML Model** uses these parameters to classify profiles as **Spam** or **Legitimate**.
